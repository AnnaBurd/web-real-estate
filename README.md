[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2bd48f01-8fed-412f-b2af-bf1b88eb54ab/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rainbow-selkie-885930/deploys)

The main objective of this project is to help the local business establish a strong connection with potential customers and create an outstanding first impression, ultimately giving the business a distinct advantage amidst the fiercely demanding marketplace.

Initial constraints that we needed to address:

- user-friendly design with an understanding of local language and cultural distinctiveness
- competitive performance on mobile devices
- smooth delivery and uncomplicated content management processes
- **restricted budget**

In this particular scenario, the approach taken was to generate static pages rather than rely on client-side or server-side rendering. The client-side rendering was ruled off due to the significance placed on mobile performance and search engine optimization (SEO). Meanwhile, the idea of spending on the development/hosting/management of the backend side ruled off the server-side rendering approach as well. Instead of overinvesting in the backend infrastructure, we choose the services of the headless CMS (with generous free tiers).

And, although static pages sound â€¦ lifeless, the app pages have been designed in a manner that does not give off a static impression entirely! The secret is the usage of component-based islands of JS interactivity whenever necessary.

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
