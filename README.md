The main objective of this project is to help the local business establish a strong connection with potential customers and create an outstanding first impression, ultimately giving the business a distinct advantage amidst the fiercely demanding marketplace.

Initial constraints that we needed to address:

- user-friendly design with an understanding of local language and cultural distinctiveness
- competitive performance on mobile devices
- smooth delivery and uncomplicated content management processes
- **restricted budget**

In this particular scenario, the approach taken was to generate static pages rather than rely on client-side or server-side rendering. The client-side rendering was ruled off due to the significance placed on mobile performance and search engine optimization (SEO). Meanwhile, the idea of spending on the development/hosting/management of the backend side ruled off the server-side rendering approach as well. Instead of overinvesting in the backend infrastructure, we choose the services of the headless CMS (with generous free tiers).

And, although static pages sound â€¦ lifeless, the app pages have been designed in a manner that does not give off a static impression entirely! The secret is the usage of component-based islands of JS interactivity whenever necessary.

During the build, Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. The `404.astro` page is exposed as the default error page. `[slug].astro` exposes dynamically-generated pages.

Astro components in `src/components/` can include pure Astro or React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
